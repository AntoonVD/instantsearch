In this example we showcase how to search simultaneously on multiple indices as you search into 1 input.

To achieve it, what we need to do is manually bind the search input value to the 2 search stores.

[See the example project on GitHub](https://github.com/algolia/vue-instantsearch-examples/tree/master/examples/multi-index).

Live example will be available soon.

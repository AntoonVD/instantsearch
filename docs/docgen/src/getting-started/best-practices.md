This page is a placeholder for best practices we recommend you to review while implementing Vue InstantSearch.

## Security

All security best practices are covered by the official [security guidelines on the Algolia documentation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/best-security-practices/#guides).

Regarding Vue InstantSearch, if there is one thing to remember, it is to use the **search only** API keys when using the Index component or manually instantiating the Store.
